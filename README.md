# Restaurant Page

A website for imaginary Restaurant called Worldwide Kitchen. 

The goal of the project was to create a restaurant page with switchable tabs using only JS to create the websites entire DOM content and use as little global code as possible making use of ES6 Modules. Webpack was used to bundle the modules.
